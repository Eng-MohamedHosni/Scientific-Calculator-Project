# Scientific Calculator Project

This project is a feature-rich scientific calculator built using **C#** and **WinForms**. It supports basic arithmetic operations, handles special cases like division by zero, deals with decimal numbers, and includes buttons for clearing and deleting entries. The application also has a modern and visually appealing user interface, designed using the **Guna Framework**.

## Features

### Basic Operations
The calculator supports all basic arithmetic operations:
1. **Addition** (+) - Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction** (-) - Subtracts one number from another.
3. **Multiplication** (×) - Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division** (÷) - Divides one number by another and handles special cases like division by zero.
5. **Modulus** (%) - Returns the remainder after division.

### Special Cases
- **Division by Zero**: The calculator gracefully handles attempts to divide by zero by displaying appropriate error messages or results.
- **Decimal Handling**: The calculator supports decimal numbers for all operations, ensuring accurate results with floating-point arithmetic.

### Additional Features
- **Delete Button**: Allows the user to delete the last entered number or operator.
- **Clear Button**: Clears all entries and resets the calculator for a new calculation.
- **Modern UI Design**: The calculator features a visually appealing and user-friendly interface designed using the **Guna Framework** for WinForms.

### Handling Special Scenarios
- **Division by Zero**: Displays a friendly error message when attempting to divide by zero.
- **Decimal Numbers**: Supports operations with decimal values, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with decimal precision.

## UI Design
The calculator features a **modern and sleek** design, with an intuitive layout. The buttons are designed to be large, easy to click, and are organized logically to enhance usability. A clean and minimalistic approach is used for the display screen and interaction feedback.

### Design Details
- **Button Layout**: Buttons for numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, ×, ÷, %, .), and other functions (Clear, Delete, Equals) are organized in a grid-like layout.
- **Display Area**: The display area shows the current input and the result of the calculation.
- **Color Scheme**: The UI features a modern color palette with contrasting colors for better visibility and user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **C#** (for the core functionality and logic of the calculator)
- **WinForms** (for the graphical user interface)
- **Guna Framework** (for enhanced UI components, such as buttons, text boxes, and styling)
